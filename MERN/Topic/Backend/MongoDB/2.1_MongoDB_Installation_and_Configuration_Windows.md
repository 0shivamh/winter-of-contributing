# CONFIGURATION:

NOTE:
**Now if your version is 4.0 or above,you don't need to create data/db in the mongodb folder.data/db is by default in our bin folder only.**

STEPS for cofiguration:
- Copy the path you noted of the data directory while installing or if not to know the path of data directory,
 go to `C drive->Program files->mongodb->server->version(folder)->bin `
(Now copy this path )


- To make sure mongodb is perfectly installed in our system,
`open cmd(command prompt)`

- paste the path you copied in step 1 under double quotation

eg->

```
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongod.exe" --version
```

which will show you something like this:

*if u are getting a ">" sign after at last,
that means it is ready to run properly.*

## WORKING WITH DATABASES

- To show all the databases peresent
write:
```
show dbs
```

(by default we have 1-3 already present)
something like this->

admin  0.000GB

config  0.000GB

local   0.000GB


## How to add documents

- open cmd(command prompt)
write:
```
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin\mongo.exe"
```

### Creating a database
 - `use {database_name}`->if not already present->creates one or if present,switches to this database(becomes active database)
(we need to add atleast one document in this created database for it to be shown under show dbs)

eg->if we are creating a database named database1,we have to write :
```
use database1

```
 - creating a collection

(to create documents,we need to first create a collection)

db.{collectionname}.insertOne({name:"reactjs",type:"frontend",fun:true})

eg->if we are creating a collection named collection1,and inserting a single document,it will look something like this:

- now if we type show dbs,we can see our newly created database there.




### Looking for documents ,collections and databases

- Type `db` to see current active databse

```
db
```

 - Type `show collections` to see the collections created under that database.
 
 ```
 show collections
 ```
 
  - Type `db.{collection_name}.find() ` to see the data(records in that collection)
  
  eg->if we gave the name collection1 to our collection, we have to write:
  
  ```
  db.collection1.find()
  ```
