# 1. Introduction
MongoDB can be used for various projects like building an application, or analysis of data, in all such similar cases we need to interact with the MongoDB server to perform operations like entering some new data into the application, reading the data, updation of data, or deletion of some wrongly entered data.

And hence we have the CRUD operations, which is the acronym for create, read, update and delete operations.

# 2. Create
The Create operation is used to insert or add new documents in a collection.  
There are two ways to add a new document to a collection.

    db.collection.insertOne()
    db.collection.insertMany()

## 2.1 db.collection.insertOne()
Using this command, we can insert one document in our collection.
### **Example:**
In the example given below, we have added the information about a single student in the student collection, using db.collection.insertOne() method.

## 2.2 db.collection.insertMany()
This command is used to add multiple documents into our collection, all at once.
### **Example:** 
In the example given below, we are inserting the details of multiple students in the student collection, using db.collection.insertMany() method.

<p>&nbsp</p>

# 3. Read
The Read operation is used to retrieve documents from a collection or in other words, they are used to query a collection for a document.

    db.collection.find()

### **Example:** 
In the example shown below, we are retrieving the details of all the students present in the student collection, using db.collection.find() method.

# 4. Update
The update operation is used to update or modify the existing documents in the collection.  
There are three ways to update the document of a collection.

    db.collection.updateOne()
    db.collection.updateMany()
    db.collection.replaceOne()

## 4.1 db.collection.updateOne()
This command is used to update a single document of the collection that satisfies the given criteria.
### **Example:** 
In this example, we are updating the branch of Ryan in student collection using db.collection.updateOne() method.

## 4.2 db.collection.updateMany()
This command is used to update multiple documents of the collection, which satisfies the criteria specified.
### **Example:** 
The below given example, updates the year of graduation of each student present in the student collection using db.collection.updateMany().

## 4.3 db.collection.replaceOne()
This command is used to simply replace a single document in the collection that satisfies the criteria.
### **Example:** 
In this example, we are replacing the name of Clarie Merk with Clarie Mark using db.collection.replaceOne().

# 5. Delete
The Delete operation is used to delete or remove the documents from a collection.  
There are two ways to delete document from a collection.  

    db.collection.deleteOne()
    db.collection.deleteMany()

## 5.1 db.collection.deleteOne()
It is used to delete a single document from the collection.
### **Example:** 
In this example, we are deleting the document of student Jake Well from the student collection using db.collection.deleteOne() method.
