## What is a Computer Virus?
<hr>

__VIRUS(Vital Information Resources Under Siege)__
```
It is the malware that supports Spyware-
the process in which personal details are kept an eye on to hack the accounts and reveal personal data.

A computer virus is a set of code with the purpose of stealing information or corrupting the victims file.
If one's computer is affected with virus then its almost impossible to remove the virus completely.
The best one can do is to protect it computer from further damage, this can be done by installing antivirus 
and other methods which will be discussed later on.

Computer Virus, much like the cold or flu virus has the ability to replicate itself and crawl to the other parts
of the system as well as to other systems too. But without the host Virus is nothing, just like the flu virus.

## How it spreads?

```

One of the ideal methods by which viruses spread is through emails, opening the attachment in the email,
visiting an infected website can cause the virus to spread to your system. It can also spread while 
connecting with already infected removable storage devices, such as USB drives.

Once a computer is infected with virus it can't be removed, only the further damage can be prevented
virus disguises itself as executable files or folder, as soon as you run or open these files or folders 
your computer is infected.

In case of USB drives the common Virus is the Resident Virus, it stays hidden inside an USB and as soon
plug-in the USB it gets stored in the system memory and the next time you boot your system it enters the BIOS 
and corrupts the whole OS.

## Mechanism

<hr>

```
Virus consists of two parts:- 
 
 1. Part that is responsible for its transfer mechanism as well as for its execution.
 2. Part responsible for the infectious mechanism and consists the main code of VIRUS.

## What are the different types of computer viruses?

<hr>

```
1. Boot sector virus
This type of virus can take control when you start — or boot — your computer. 
One way it can spread is by plugging an infected USB drive into your computer.

2. Web scripting virus
This type of virus exploits the code of web browsers and web pages. 
If you access such a web page, the virus can infect your computer.

3. Browser hijacker
This type of virus “hijacks” certain web browser functions, and you may be 
automatically directed to an unintended website.

4. Resident virus
This is a general term for any virus that inserts itself in a computer system’s memory. 
A resident virus can execute anytime when an operating system loads.

5. Direct action virus
This type of virus comes into action when you execute a file containing a virus. 
Otherwise, it remains dormant.

6. Polymorphic virus
A polymorphic virus changes its code each time an infected file is executed. 
It does this to evade antivirus programs.

7. File infector virus
This common virus inserts malicious code into executable files — files used to perform 
certain functions or operations on a system.

8. Multipartite virus
This kind of virus infects and spreads in multiple ways. It can infect both program files and system sectors.

9. Macro virus
Macro viruses are written in the same macro language used for software applications. 
Such viruses spread when you open an infected document, often through email attachments.

## Ways to protect against VIRUS

<hr>

```

1. Make sure your computer has updated anti-virus software running locally. Automatic updates are essential for 
   effective virus protection.
2. Never open an email attachment from an unknown source.
3. Take caution when opening graphics and media attachments, as viruses can be disguised as such files.
4. Never plug-in an USB that is suspicious to contain VIRUS.
