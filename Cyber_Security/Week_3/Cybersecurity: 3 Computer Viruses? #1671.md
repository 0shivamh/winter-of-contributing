## What is a Computer Virus?
<hr>

```
A computer virus, much like a flu or cold virus, that is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability 
to replicate itself. Virus is nothing on its own and thus needs a host. The host helps the virus get into 
other systems and execute it when triggered. In other words, the computer virus spreads by itself into 
other executable code or documents. 

VIRUS(Vital Information Resources Under Siege) is the malware that supports Spyware-
the process in which personal details are kept an eye on to hack the accounts and reveal personal data.

## How it spreads?

```

One of the ideal methods by which viruses spread is through emails, opening the attachment in the email, 
visiting an infected website can cause the virus to spread to your system. It can also spread while 
connecting with already infected removable storage devices, such as USB drives.

## Mechanism

<hr>

```
Virus consists of two parts:- 
 
 1. Part that is responsible for its transfer mechanism as well as for its execution.
 2. Part responsible for the infectious mechanism and consists the main code of VIRUS.

## What are the different types of computer viruses?

<hr>

```
1. Boot sector virus
This type of virus can take control when you start — or boot — your computer. 
One way it can spread is by plugging an infected USB drive into your computer.

2. Web scripting virus
This type of virus exploits the code of web browsers and web pages. 
If you access such a web page, the virus can infect your computer.

3. Browser hijacker
This type of virus “hijacks” certain web browser functions, and you may be 
automatically directed to an unintended website.

4. Resident virus
This is a general term for any virus that inserts itself in a computer system’s memory. 
A resident virus can execute anytime when an operating system loads.

5. Direct action virus
This type of virus comes into action when you execute a file containing a virus. 
Otherwise, it remains dormant.

6. Polymorphic virus
A polymorphic virus changes its code each time an infected file is executed. 
It does this to evade antivirus programs.

7. File infector virus
This common virus inserts malicious code into executable files — files used to perform 
certain functions or operations on a system.

8. Multipartite virus
This kind of virus infects and spreads in multiple ways. It can infect both program files and system sectors.

9. Macro virus
Macro viruses are written in the same macro language used for software applications. 
Such viruses spread when you open an infected document, often through email attachments.

## Ways to protect against VIRUS

<hr>

```

1. Make sure your computer has updated anti-virus software running locally. Automatic updates are essential for 
   effective virus protection. Combined with server-side scanning, you now have two layers of security.
2. Disable message preview in your email client, especially on Windows platforms. 
   Otherwise, malicious programs attached to incoming messages may execute automatically and infect your computer.
3. Take caution when opening graphics and media attachments, as viruses can be disguised as such files.
