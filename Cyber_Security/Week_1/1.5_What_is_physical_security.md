## What is Physical Security? 

In simple terms, physical security refers to the protection of building sites and equipment (and all information and software contained therein) from theft, vandalism, natural disaster, manmade catastrophes, and accidental damage (e.g., from electrical surges, extreme temperatures, spilled tea, etc). 


Physical security measures are designed to protect buildings, and safeguard the equipment inside. In short, they keep unwanted people out, and give access to authorized individuals. While network and cybersecurity are important, preventing physical security breaches and threats is key to keeping your technology and data safe, as well as any staff or faculty that have access to the building. Without physical security plans in place, your office or building is left open to criminal activity, and liable for types of physical security threats including theft, vandalism, fraud, and even accidents. 

## Its importance

Physical security is a vital part of any security plan and is fundamental to all security efforts - without it, information security, software security, user access security, and network security - are considerably more difficult to initiate.
 
The modern business owner faces security risks at every turn. As technology continues to advance, threats can come from just about anywhere, and the importance of physical security has never been greater. While many companies focus their prevention efforts on cybersecurity and hacking, physical threats shouldn’t be ignored. Every breach, big or small, impacts your business, from financial losses, to damaged reputation, to your employees feeling insecure at the office. Even for small businesses, having the right physical security measures in place can make all the difference in keeping your business, and your data, safe.

## 5 key principles of Physical Security

1. Deterrence - These are the physical security measures that keep people out or away from the space. Deterrent security components can be a physical barrier, such as a wall, door, or turnstyle. Technology can also fall into this category. Access control systems and video security cameras deter unauthorized individuals from attempting to access the building, too. 

2. Detection - Just because you have deterrents in place, doesn’t mean you’re fully protected. Detection components of your physical security system help identify a potential security event or intruder. Sensors, alarms, and automatic notifications are all examples of physical security detection. 

3. Delay - There are certain security systems that are designed to slow intruders down as they attempt to enter a facility or building. Access control, such as requiring a key card or mobile credential, is one method of delay. Smart physical security strategies have multiple ways to delay intruders, which makes it easier to mitigate a breach before too much damage is caused.

4. Response - These are the components that are in place once a breach or intrusion occurs. Examples of physical security response include communication systems, building lockdowns, and contacting emergency services or first responders. 

5. Mitigate - Measures that maximise the protection provided at the perimeter or surrounding the asset being secured to minimise the effects of, prevent, or stop an attack.
