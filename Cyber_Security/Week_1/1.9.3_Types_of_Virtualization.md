# _______________________TYPES OF VIRTUALISATION_______________________

<!--### WHAT IS VIRTUALISATION?
Virtualisation is a process, which allows us to run the image of multiple operating systems on a physical computer.<br>
Images of operating systems are called virtual machines, and it is basically a software representation of a physical machine that can execute or perform the same 
function as of physical machine.<br>
Each virtual machine contains a seperate copy of os with its own resources.<br>

<!--### FEATURES OF VIRTUALISATION:
- `` Partitioning `` <br>
- `` Isolation ``<br>
- ``  Encapsulation``<br>
- `` Interposition ``<br>-->


### 1. SERVER VIRTUALISATION

<!--Single physical layer is partitioned into multiple virtual servers.<br>
Each virtual server has its own hardware resources like cpu, ram, network controller,hypervisor etc.<br>
Server virtualisation ensures scalability of platform as per volume of data.-->

### 2. APPLICATION VIRTUALISATION:

Application virtualisation encapsulates applications on underlining of physical computer system.<br>
It improves managebility and portability of an application.<br>
This is a virtualisation layer which is inserted between an application and os.<br>
It allows the running of legacy apps, enables cross-platform operations, prevents conflicts with other virtualized apps.<br>

### USE CASES:

- ``Cost control ``<br>
 - ``Application mobility ``<br>
 - `` Secure remote access capability``<br>
 - `` simplified magnification``<br>

### Benefits: 
 - ``Simple installation and easy deployement ``<br>
 - ``Better portability ``<br>
 - ``Reduced conflicts between two or more application ``<br>
 - `` Easy rollback, update and support``<br>
 - `` Independent of operating system``<br>
 - ``Security``<br>

### 3. NETWORK VIRTUALISATION:

<!--It uses virtual networking as a pool of connection resources.<br>
It helps in defining different networks with different sets of performance and capacities to manage the large amount of data to be distributed.-->

### 4. PROCESSOR AND MEMORY VIRTUALISATION:

<!--It optimizes the power of processor and maximizes its performance.<br>
Memory virtualisation decouples memory from the servers<br> -->

### 5. DATA AND STORAGE VIRTUALISATION:

<!--It provides and abstract service that, delivers data continuously in a consistent form without the prior knowledge of the underlining physical data base.<br>
It provides dynamic linked data service.<br> -->
