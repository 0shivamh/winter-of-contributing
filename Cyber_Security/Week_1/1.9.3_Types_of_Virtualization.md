# _______________________TYPES OF VIRTUALISATION_______________________

### WHAT IS VIRTUALISATION?
Virtualisation is a process, which allows us to run the image of multiple operating systems on a physical computer.<br>
Images of operating systems are called virtual machines, and it is basically a software representation of a physical machine that can execute or perform the same 
function as of physical machine.<br>
Each virtual machine contains a seperate copy of os with its own resources.<br>

### FEATURES OF VIRTUALISATION:
- `` Partitioning `` <br>
- `` Isolation ``<br>
- ``  Encapsulation``<br>
- `` Interposition ``<br>

## TYPES OF VIRTUALISATION

### SERVER VIRTUALISATION:

Single physical layer is partitioned into multiple virtual servers.<br>
Each virtual server has its own hardware resources like cpu, ram, network controller,hypervisor etc.<br>
Server virtualisation ensures scalability of platform as per volume of data.

### APPLICATION VIRTUALISATION:

Application virtualisation encapsulates applications on underlining of physical computer system.<br>
It improves managebility and portability of an application.<br>
This is a virtualisation layer which is inserted between an application and os.<br>
It allows the running of legacy apps, enables cross-platform operations, prevents conflicts with other virtualized apps.<br>

### NETWORK VIRTUALISATION:

It uses virtual networking as a pool of connection resources.<br>
It helps in defining different networks with different sets of performance and capacities to manage the large amount of data to be distributed.

### PROCESSOR AND MEMORY VIRTUALISATION:

It optimizes the power of processor and maximizes its performance.<br>
Memory virtualisation decouples memory from the servers<br>

### DATA AND STORAGE VIRTUALISATION:

It provides and abstract service that, delivers data continuously in a consistent form without the prior knowledge of the underlining physical data base.<br>
It provides dynamic linked data service.<br>
