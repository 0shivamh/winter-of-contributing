          The Act provides legal verification for digital signatures and
          considers contracts/documents made through electronic channels as
          valid, but the act is not applicable for some of the documents which
          include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Execution of Power of Attorney</li>
          <li>Execution of a Will</li>
          <li>Contract for the sale of conveyance of immovable property</li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <p>
          There is no section inside the law that deals with spamming. Spamming
          is sending out emails/messages in bulk to many users. Not only spam
          messages are irritating but these messages might cause serious
          problems if they contained some malicious links to download malware in
          the user's system.

        <h3>Identity Theft</h3>

        </div>
        <p>
          Identity theft is gathering someone's private and personal information
          illegally. This can give attackers a chance to threaten and take
          ransoms from the victims or even worse can publicly reveal that
          information. The IT Act fails to cover this topic.
        </p>
        <h3>Phishing</h3>

            width="30%"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Phishing is the method where an attacker disguises himself/herself as
          a trustworthy entity and steals information out of the victim. This
          can be done in various ways like email phishing, spear phishing, etc.
          This is also a loophole in IT Act as it fails to make any laws
          regarding phishing

        </div>
        <p>
          Information about the customers held by banks is very confidential and
          should be protected at any cost. A lot of risks is involved in
          preventing leaks of this information. Though, the IT Act states about
          unauthorized access but it does not lay any duty upon banks to protect
          the details of customers.
