## What is it ?🤔

information security as the name suggests “Information”  & “Security” is the practice/implementation of protecting ones data/information by reducing or mitigating information risks. Sometimes, Information Security in short is also referred to as **InfoSec**.



## Some Common Information Security Risks

In everyday operations, there are many risks that can affect an individuals or an organizations system and information security. Some common ones to be aware of,

👉 **Social engineering attacks**

👉**Advanced persistent threats (APT)**

👉**Insider threats**

👉**Cryptojacking**

👉**Distributed denial of service (DDoS)**

👉**Ransomware**

👉**Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack**



## The misconception: Information Security vs Cybersecurity

These two terms are often used interchangeably, so one might confuse one with the other. Information Security or InfoSec is protecting the data from any forms of threats, while Cybersecurity is protecting anything or everything that comes under the cyber realm. In other words, you can say that InfoSec is a subdomain of cybersecurity.





## Principles of InfoSec

There are some core components to InfoSec, 3 to be exact which can be considered as the heart💗 of InfoSec. These are known as the **CIA triad** of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Confidentiality🐱‍👤:** Its simply keeping data from disclosure to unauthorized individuals, entities and process and only those who have permission can access it.

**Integrity⚖:** Its maintaining accuracy and completeness of data. It is the protection from unauthorized modifications (e.g., add, delete, or change) of data so that the data can be trusted to be accurate and complete.

**Availability🕓:** It simply means that data should be available whenever it is needed. This requires the computing systems and other systems to be functioning correctly and remain available at all times to provide the necessary data when needed.





## InfoSec Technologies

There’s a wide variety of tools and technologies that can be used in creating an effective information security strategy. In some cases even combination of these tools and technologies. Some of these are,

👉**Firewalls**

👉**Security incident and event management (SIEM)**

👉**Data loss prevention (DLP)**

👉**Intrusion detection system (IDS)**

👉**Intrusion prevention system (IPS)**

👉**User behavioural analytics (UBA)**

👉**Blockchain cybersecurity**

👉**Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**

👉**Cloud security posture management (CSPM)**





## Certifications in InfoSec

InfoSec is an extensive topic and it takes a lot of hard work and time to train properly to protect your or your organizations information. One way to achieve this is through certifications and these certifications gives a proof that professionals meet a certain standard of expertise and are aware of best practices.

Two most common ones;

👉 **CompTIA Security+**

👉**Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**
