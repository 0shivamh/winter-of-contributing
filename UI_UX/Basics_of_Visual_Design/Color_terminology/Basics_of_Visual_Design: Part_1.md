<h1 align="center">Basics of Visual Design</h1>

Visual design strives to increase the aesthetic appeal and **usefulness** of a design/product by using appropriate *imagery*, *typography*, *space*, *layout*, and *colour*. Aesthetics are only one aspect of visual design. Designers carefully position pieces to build interfaces that improve user experience and increase conversion.

*See why Visual Design is about more than product prettiness.*
> *“Problems with visual design can turn users off so quickly that they never discover all the smart choices you made with navigation or interaction design.”*

## **Visual Design is Aesthetic,** *Strategic* **Design**

Users’ first impressions typically form in `50 milliseconds`. This fact reflects the visceral level of [emotional design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/emotional-design) — in other words, the user’s first impression of or gut reaction to a design. If they don’t like what you show them in those critical moments, they will leave. So, visual design is a vital part of your work as a designer.

 Many people mistake it to mean that designers include attractive elements just to maximize an item’s appeal. Actually, you use visual design to create and organize elements to 
 
 `A) lead the user’s eye to an item’s functionality`, and 
 
 `B) make the aesthetics consistent.`
 
 For instance, designers compose and arrange website content around each page’s purpose and are careful to ensure that content gives off the right **visual cues**. The smallest and subtlest details will affect what users think and how they feel. So, you must always **show them the right things in the right way**. Your enemy here is **user uncertainty**. If your users have to stop and think about your design, they won’t trust it—or you. Therefore, a visual design should **draw their attention to the important aspects and strike the balance between a fresh, powerful design and something they expect to see**. How you apply visual design will depend on your product, its organization/industry and its users (including their culture). A major factor in visual design is that you work to accommodate **user limitations** such as **cognitive load**. For example, you use chunking to help users understand and remember information more easily.

## **Visual Design** *Elements*, **Analyzed**

These are some of the most common **Elements of Visual Design :**

1. **Lines** (straight/curved/geometric/organic) – use these to create divisions, textures and shapes.

2. **Shapes** – use lines, different colors, etc. to create enclosed/self-contained areas.

3. **Negative space/whitespace** – use the blank area around a "positive" shape to create a figure/ground effect or calm the design overall.

4. **Volume** – use this to show the rich fullness of all three dimensions of elements on two-dimensional screens.

5. **Value** – use this to set the relationship between lightness and darkness, typically through a light source to create shadows and highlights.

6. **Color** – use this to set the theme/tone and attract attention.

7. **Texture** – use this to define an object’s surface.
