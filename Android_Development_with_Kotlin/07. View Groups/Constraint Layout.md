When you are making an app there are various Views in it, it could be like a TextView an ImageView and etc. <br />
Every View has a relationship with each other, for example:-
  an image may be next to some text, and buttons may form a row. 
  

#### A ViewGroup is a container that View objects can sit in, and is responsible for arranging the Views inside it. <br /><br /> The arrangement, or layout, can change depending on the size and aspect ratio of the screen of the Android device that the app is running on, and the layout can adapt to whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.

### One kind of ViewGroup is a ConstraintLayout, which helps you arrange the Views inside it in a flexible way.
